This folder contains python and matlab codes used to reproduce the results in:

Ding Zhao, Macheng Shen, Evaluation of Automated Vehicles Encountering Pedestrians at Unsignalized Crossings.

Four different models are deployed to learn a stochastic model from pedetrain crossing data collected at an unsignalized crossing: 

'Feedforward.py': trains a two layer feedforward neural network.
'LSTM.py': trains a single layer LSTM nerual network.
'main.m' in 'HMM' folder trains a Hidden Markov Model.
'main_rf.m' in 'Random Forest' folder trains a random forest classifier.

Installations: To run the python code, Theano and Keras backends are required.
